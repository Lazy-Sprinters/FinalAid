 # Problem Statement

Since the last week, many unclaimed dead bodies were found floating in rivers in eastern UP and western Bihar suspected to be COVID victims. Even though there are guidelines in place to respectfully cremate or bury the bodies, many poor families hit by the pandemic don’t even have the resources to carry out the final rites of their deceased relatives. Not only is this a humane problem but also a hygiene issue especially in times of COVID. Even unclaimed bodies left in the middle of nowhere is an insult to the health system in place.
Also, there are numerous selfless workers putting their lives on the line to work continuously in cremation grounds and burial sites. They are nameless and prefer to be anonymous and hence very few get any kind of support.


# Proposed Solution

Bridge the ultra-wide gap between people willing to help and those who actually need our help. A web portal where people can donate so that the families whose members have passed away and are too poor to pay for the funeral can say goodbye to their loved ones instead of just discarding the bodies. It will also give a solution to the crematorium, kabristan and church committees who can raise a request after performing the rites so that their resources aren’t stretched. Our portal will have a buffer which donates the minimum amount required to carry out the final passage rites which will be refilled by the donations of the public.

Supporting the selfless workers is also an issue and the donations can also be made to compensate the hard work of those workers by sponsoring their meals or healthcare needs.
